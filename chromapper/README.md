# ChroMapper Script

This is just a compilation of my scripts for CM-JS plugin.

## How to use

Using CM-JS plugin, it allows to run the script to be ran inside ChroMapper providing more utilities.
Some script does not use functions provided by the library, but for development purpose uses many from types files.

Your directory should look something like this for any of the script to work properly.

```js
.\plugins\CM-JS\library\ // provided from the folder here
.\plugins\CM-JS\<any script>.js // any .js script must be placed where .dll is
.\plugins\CM-JS\<any script>.js
.\plugins\CM-JS\<any script>.js
.\plugins\CM-JS\CM-JS.dll
```

## Note

Some of the scripts may not be up to date with recent ChroMapper and CM-JS plugin. If one of the scripts is not working,
let me know regarding it to fix depending on priority OR you may fix it yourself.

### Pre-requisite:

-   ChroMapper v0.9.0
-   CM-JS 1.3.0
