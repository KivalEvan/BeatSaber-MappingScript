# Beat Saber Mapping Script

A bunch of script compilation I made for mapping.

## Prerequisite

- Any ESM, Node module, and TS supported runtime
  - [Deno](https://deno.land/) 1.45 or latest
  - [Bun](https://deno.land/) 1.1 or latest

## Important Note

Some of these map scripts are either work-in-progress or not released to public for several reasons.
I do allow anyone to snoop in and use any of my work (credit is highly appreciated), but I do not
recommend anyone to use said map scripts as it is not a final product.
