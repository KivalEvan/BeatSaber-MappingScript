# Beat Saber Mapping Script

A bunch of script compilation I made for mapping.

## Prerequisite

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) 1.21.0 or higher (For `.ts` script)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.6.1 or higher (For `.js` script)

## Important Note

Some of these map scripts are either work-in-progress or not released to public for several reasons.
I do allow anyone to snoop in and use any of my work (credit is highly appreciated), but I do not
recommend anyone to use said map scripts as it is not a final product.
